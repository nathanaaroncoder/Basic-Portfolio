		<hr>
		<p>A majority of my career has been in the arts, specifically within the dance world. I have made the plunge into development and couldn't be more excited. I graduated from Rutgers University in 2013 with a BFA in Dance, and since then I've been and aerialist and dancer for Royal Caribbean, being able to travel to many parts of the world. Aside from dancing in a few dance companies in New York City, I also had the opportunity to co-direct and choreograph and show in Brazil which has been a huge sucess since March 2016.</p>
